# Arduino-Galileo-Gen-2---Frequency-Player-With-LCD-Choice-Screen

Necessary Libraries:
1. RGB_LCD (from Grove)
2. Wire (Core Arduino Library)


The frequencies for the songs come from a python program written which converts .MIDI files to frequencies and durations of these delays. These .MIDI files are not owned by me and are obtained through:  http://musescore.com
