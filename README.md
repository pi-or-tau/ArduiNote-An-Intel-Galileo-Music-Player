# ArduiNote - An Intel Galileo Music Player

Necessary Libraries:
1. RGB_LCD (from Grove)
2. Wire (Core Arduino Library)
3. python-midi library written by “vishnubob” (https://github.com/vishnubob/python-midi)

The frequencies for the songs come from a python program written which converts .MIDI files to frequencies and durations of these frequencies. These .MIDI files are not owned by me and are obtained through:  http://musescore.com
